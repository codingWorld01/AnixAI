Unlike traditional AI, which is focused on analyzing or classifying existing data, generative AI produces new and original outputs based on the patterns it has learned from existing datasets. For example, if trained on thousands of articles, generative AI can write a brand-new blog post. If trained on artwork, it can generate new paintings. This ability to create content makes it highly versatile and powerful."
